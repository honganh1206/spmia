Service granularity - There needs a balance so that each microservice has the right level of responsibility

Communication protocols - JSON is the most common by far

Interface design - A well-design microservice interface makes using your service intuitive

Configuration management of service - The configuration should move between different environments so that you do not have to change the core application code

Event processing between services - Decouple your microservice to minimize hardcoded dependencies between services and increase resiliency
