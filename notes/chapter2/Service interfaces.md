When design service interfaces, consider:

1. Embrace the REST philosophy - Use the standard HTTP verbs GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
2. Use URI to communicate intent - The URI should describe the different resources in your problem domain and provides relationships of resources
3. Use JSON for service communication & HTTP status code for result communication
