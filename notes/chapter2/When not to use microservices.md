Aspects to consider:

## Complexity of building distributed systems 

Microservice architectures require a high degree of operational maturity, so use it if your organization is willing to invest in automation and operational work

## Server sprawl 

A large microservice-based application can have 50-100 servers running, so the flexibility of microservices has to be weighed against the cost of running the servers

## Type of application 

If we are building department-level applications, then monolithic approach should be considered

## Data transformations and consistency 

Microservice architecture is meant to abstract away a small number of tables to perform CRUD operations. 

If we want to do complex data aggregation or transformation across multiple sources of data, the microservices will take on too much responsibility
